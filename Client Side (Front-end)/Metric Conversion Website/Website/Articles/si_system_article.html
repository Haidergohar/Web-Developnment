                                            The International System of Units
                                            Just as the original conception of the metric system had grown out of the
                                            problems scientists encountered in dealing with the medieval system,…
                                            Rapid advances in science and technology in the 19th and 20th centuries
                                            fostered the development of several overlapping systems of units of
                                            measurements as scientists improvised to meet the practical needs of their
                                            disciplines. The early international system devised to rectify this
                                            situation was called the metre-kilogram-second (MKS) system. The General
                                            Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) added three new units (among
                                            others) in 1948: a unit of force (the newton), defined as that force which
                                            gives to a mass of one kilogram an acceleration of one metre per second per
                                            second; a unit of energy (the joule), defined as the work done when the
                                            point of application of a newton is displaced one metre in the direction of
                                            the force; and a unit of power (the watt), which is the power that in one
                                            second gives rise to energy of one joule. All three units are named for
                                            eminent scientists.

                                            The 1960 International System builds on the MKS system. Its seven basic
                                            units, from which other units are derived, were defined as follows: for
                                            length, the metre, defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum in
                                            1/299,792,458 second; for mass, the kilogram, which equaled 1,000 grams as
                                            defined by the international prototype kilogram of platinum-iridium in the
                                            keeping of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sèvres,
                                            France; for time, the second, the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of
                                            radiation associated with a specified transition of the cesium-133 atom; for
                                            electric current, the ampere, which was the current that, if maintained in
                                            two wires placed one metre apart in a vacuum, would produce a force of 2 ×
                                            10−7 newton per metre of length; for luminous intensity, the candela,
                                            defined as the intensity in a given direction of a source emitting radiation
                                            of frequency 540 × 1012 hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that
                                            direction of 1/683 watt per steradian; for amount of substance, the mole,
                                            defined as containing as many elementary entities of a substance as there
                                            are atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon-12; and for thermodynamic temperature, the
                                            kelvin.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The CGPM in 2018 agreed to a proposal that from May 20, 2019, the kilogram,
                                            the ampere, the mole, and the kelvin would be redefined in terms of
                                            fundamental physical constants. For the kilogram, the constant chosen was
                                            Planck’s constant, which would be defined to be equal to 6.62607015 × 10−34
                                            joule second. One joule is equal to one kilogram times metre squared per
                                            second squared. Since the second and the metre were already defined, the
                                            kilogram would then be determined by accurate measurements of Planck’s
                                            constant. The ampere would be redefined such that the elementary charge
                                            would be equal to 1.602176634 × 10−19 coulomb. The kelvin would be redefined
                                            such that the Boltzmann constant would be equal to 1.380649 × 10−23 joule
                                            per kelvin, and the mole would be redefined such that the Avogadro constant
                                            would be equal to 6.02214076 × 1023 per mole.
