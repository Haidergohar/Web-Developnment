                                        <p>
                                            The history of the metric system began in the Age of Enlightenment with
                                            simple notions of length and weight taken from natural ones, and decimal
                                            multiples and fractions of them. The system was so useful it became the
                                            standard of France and Europe in half a century. Other dimensions with unity
                                            ratios[Note 1] were added, and it went on to be adopted by the world.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The first practical realisation of the metric system came in 1799, during
                                            the French Revolution, when the existing system of measures, which had
                                            become impractical for trade, was replaced by a decimal system based on the
                                            kilogram and the metre. In the pre-scientific era, the basic units were
                                            taken from the natural world: the unit of length, the metre, was based on
                                            the dimensions of the Earth, and the unit of mass, the kilogram, was based
                                            on the mass of water having a volume of one litre or a cubic decimetre.
                                            Reference copies for both units were manufactured in platinum and remained
                                            the standards of measure for the next 90 years. After a period of reversion
                                            to the mesures usuelles due to unpopularity of the metric system, the
                                            metrication of France as well as much of Europe was complete by mid-century.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In the middle of the 19th century, James Clerk Maxwell put forward the
                                            concept of a coherent system where a small number of units of measure were
                                            defined as base units, and all other units of measure, called derived units,
                                            were defined in terms of the base units. Maxwell proposed three base units:
                                            length, mass and time. Advances in electromagnetism in the 19th century
                                            necessitated new units to be defined, and multiple incompatible systems of
                                            such units came into usage; none could be reconciled with the existing
                                            system of mechanical units. This impasse was resolved by Giovanni Giorgi,
                                            who in 1901 proved that a coherent system that incorporated electromagnetic
                                            units had to have an electromagnetic unit as a fourth base unit.
                                        </p>

                                            The seminal 1875 Treaty of the Metre resulted in the fashioning and
                                            distribution of metre and kilogram artefacts, the standards of the future
                                            coherent system that became the SI, and the creation of an international
                                            body Conférence générale des poids et mesures or CGPM to oversee systems of
                                            weights and measures based on them.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In 1960, the CGPM launched the International System of Units (in French the
                                            Système international d'unités or SI) which had six "base units": the metre,
                                            kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin (subsequently renamed the "kelvin")
                                            and candela; as well as 16 further units derived from the base units. A
                                            seventh base unit, the mole, and six additional derived units were added in
                                            succeeding years through the close of the twentieth century. During this
                                            period, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light, and the
                                            second was redefined in terms of the microwave frequency of a cesium atomic
                                            clock. Since the end of the 20th century, an effort has been undertaken to
                                            redefine the ampere, kilogram, mole and kelvin in terms of invariant
                                            constants of physics.
