                    <p> The Pakistani Rupee is the currency of Pakistan. The subunit of the Rupee, the Paisa, has not
                        been issued since 1994. The denominations of coins are 1, 2 and 5 Rupees and for notes 10, 20,
                        50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 Rupees.</p>

                    <p>Most Pakistani Rupee banknotes have the portrait of Muhammad Ali Jinnah on them. He was the first
                        Governor General and died a year after the country gained independence from the British Raj in
                        1948. Alongside his portrait the Urdu writing reads 'Hasool-e-Rizq-Halal Ibaadat hai' which
                        means 'Seeking honest livelihood is the Worship of God.'</p>

                    <h2>Origin:</h2>

                    <p>The word Rupee or Rupaya comes from the word 'Sanskrit' which means 'a coin of silver that has
                        been stamped or impressed with an image or likeness.' The first Rupee was introduced by Sher
                        Shah Suri who ruled the Sur Empire in North India from 1540–1545.</p>

                    China's official currency is known as the Renminbi but is often referred to as the Chinese Yuan.
                    Renminbi is the official name given by the Communist People's Republic of China in 1949. "Renminbi"
                    means "The People's currency." The Yuan is a subunit of the Renminbi currency with one Yuan being
                    made up of 10 Jiǎo (角) and a Jiǎo is made up of 10 Fēn (分). Renminbi banknotes come in denominations
                    of ¥0.1, ¥0.2, ¥0.5, ¥1, ¥2, ¥5, ¥10, ¥20, ¥50 and ¥100 and coins of ¥0.01, ¥0.02, ¥0.05, ¥0.1, ¥0.5
                    and ¥1.</br></br>

                    Chinese people don't often refer to "Renminbi" or "Yuan" and instead use the colloquial name "Kuai"
                    which means "piece." Although not currently used much outside of China, the Renminbi is expected to
                    become a major world currency for trading in the future.
                    </br>
                    <h2>Origin:</h2>

                    Renminbi banknotes were first established in December 1948, roughly one year before the
                    establishment of the People's Republic of China. Initially it was only circulated in notes and
                    replaced multiple currencies that were in use at the time. The government used the new currency to
                    ease the hyperinflation experienced by the country during the Kuomintang period and the currency was
                    re-valued in 1955.

                    reserve currency. Multiple countries use the US Dollar as their primary or secondary currency. The
                    Dollar is made up of 100 Cents and coins come in denominations of 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, 50¢ and $1. Bank
                    notes are available in $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100.</br></br>

                    US Dollar banknotes are made from cotton and known as 'Greenbacks' because of their green and black

                    <h2>Origin:</h2>

                    The Dollar was first declared the official currency of the United States on 6 July, 1785 but the
                    United States Mint wasn’t established until 1792. The Coinage Act stated that coins would be made of
                    gold, silver and copper in denominations of $10, $5 and $2.5 and that all coins must show the word
                    “Liberty” and resemble such sentiment and the year of issue on one side and that on the reverse, all
                    coins should show an eagle with the words “United States of America.” In 1863 the first $1 banknote
                    was issued as legal tender.

                    The Saudi Riyal is the official currency of Saudi Arabia. One Riyal is subdivided into 100 Halala.
                    Riyal banknotes are available in 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 and 500 Riyals. Coins come in denominations
                    of 5 and 10 Halala, though not largely used, the 25 Halala or quarter Riyal, the 50 Halala or the
                    half Riyal and the 100 Halala. The fifth issue of the Saudi Riyal was issued in 2007. The new series
                    have the latest and most advanced security system to prevent counterfeiting.</br></br>

                    In 2012 a total of 152.5 billion Saudi Riyal notes were printed. This is 505 times more than the
                    value of coins minted in the same year. The largest quantities printed amongst the Saudi Riyal
                    denominations was the 500 Riyal note with a total print value of SR122 billion. The least printed
                    note was the SR20 Riyal note with a value of only SR180.6 million.

                    <h2>Origin:</h2>

                    The Saudi currency used today is a descendant of the Maria Theresa Thaler which was a silver bullion
                    coin used in world trade since 1741. It was named after Empress Maria Theresa who ruled Austria,
                    Hungry and Bohemia from 1740 to 1780. The name Thaler evolved into the word Daaler and Daler, which
                    then became Dollar.
